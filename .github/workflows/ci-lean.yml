# WHY-FILE: Lean deliverables are proofs; broken proofs must not merge.
# REQ: Any check that can be run locally MUST be available locally via pre-commit.
# REQ: CI MUST NOT introduce arbitrary rules that are not reproducible locally.

name: CI Lean

# WHY: Validate repo contents on pushes to main branch and pull requests.

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # WHY: Run when pushing to main branch.
  pull_request:
    branches: [main] # WHY: Run on pull requests targeting main branch.
  workflow_dispatch: # WHY: Allow manual triggering from Actions tab.

permissions: # WHY: Use least privileges required.
  contents: read

env:
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1" # WHY: Real-time logging.
  PYTHONIOENCODING: "utf-8" # WHY: Ensure UTF-8 encoding for international characters.

jobs:
  ci:
    name: Repository checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # WHY: Linux environment matches most production deployments
    timeout-minutes: 10 # WHY: Prevent hanging jobs. If over time, likely stuck.
